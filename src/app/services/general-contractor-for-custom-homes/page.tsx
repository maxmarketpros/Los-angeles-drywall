        title: "Rigorous Pre-Qualification",
        description: "Before a subcontractor ever steps foot onto your Paradise property, they must survive our vetting protocol. We require extensive proof of liability insurance, worker's compensation, and a proven track record of executing high-end, bespoke residential finishes without compromise."

        title: "Master Scheduling & Sequencing",
        description: "A multi-million dollar custom home requires a violently enforced timeline. We sequence trades perfectly to avoid a 'stacked job site' where plumbers and electricians are fighting for the same spatial footprint, which always results in sloppy, rushed work and catastrophic delays."
    },

        title: "Daily On-Site Superintendents",
        description: "We do not manage custom builds from an excel spreadsheet in an office. We deploy seasoned, aggressive superintendents to the physical site every single day. They are heavily involved in answering micro-level trade questions instantly to prevent costly work stoppages."
    },
    {
        title: "Zero-Tolerance Quality Control",
        description: "HRF Customs acts as the ultimate filter. We scrutinize the mechanical rough-ins before drywall is hung, laser-check flooring substrates before $100,000 worth of hardwood is delivered, and demand tear-outs for any subcontractor work that fails our extreme internal standards."
    },
    {
        title: "Financial Draw Management",
        description: "We protect your capital. Subcontractors are only paid when their specific scope of work has been completely verified by our superintendents to meet local Cache County building codes and our proprietary structural demands. No front-loading, no financial surprises."

const faqs = [
    {
        question: "How do you select your subcontractors for custom luxury homes?",
        answer: "Our subcontractor roster is highly exclusive. We only utilize specialized tradesmen who focus entirely on the custom residential market. We do not hire massive commercial volume crews who are trained to work fast rather than work perfectly. Every plumber, finish carpenter, and electrician we hire understands that millimeter-level tolerances are the minimum acceptable standard."
    },
    {
        question: "Does HRF Customs perform any of the labor internally?",
        answer: "Yes. Unlike 'paper contractors' who sub out 100% of the build, HRF Customs possesses elite internal crews that specialize in the foundational bones of the home—specifically mass excavation, complex architectural concrete, and primary structural heavy timber framing. This allows us to control the most critical path schedule items directly."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens if a subcontractor causes a massive delay or damage?",
        answer: "As your General Contractor, we absorb that liability entirely on your behalf. We explicitly write tight performance clauses into our master subcontractor agreements. If a trade damages an existing finish, they are legally compelled to replace it at their cost. If they fail to meet a schedule, they are immediately replaced from our verified bench of secondary trades."
    },
    {
        question: "How involved will I need to be in the day-to-day management?",
        answer: "Minimal to none. The entire purpose of hiring HRF Customs as your elite General Contractor is to insulate you from the chaotic realities of job site logistics, weather mitigation, and trade coordination. You will receive consolidated, highly digestible executive summaries, while we fight the daily battles in the dirt."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you utilize modern construction management software?",
        answer: "We deploy bleeding-edge project management stacks. You will have real-time digital access to daily field logs, annotated site photography, up-to-the-minute budget tracking, and formalized RFI (Request for Information) documentation. Absolute transparency is a non-negotiable standard."

                                    Managing the construction of a bespoke, multi-million dollar estate in Northern Utah is an incredibly hostile environment for the unprepared. You are not just pouring concrete and placing lumber; you are actively commanding a small army of independent tradesmen, navigating fragile municipal supply chains, and combating extreme high-elevation weather patterns that threaten to destroy budgets daily.

                                    HRF Customs operates under a strict command-and-control methodology. We are not passive schedule coordinators. As an elite general contractor, we act as the absolute authority on the job site. We ruthlessly vet every single specialized subcontractor against extreme quality metrics before they are permitted to touch your asset. We filter out volume-driven tract builders who lack the refinement required for bespoke finish carpentry and complex mechanical routing.

We manage the liability, we enforce the master timeline against dozens of competing schedules, and we assume absolute accountability for ensuring that the final architectural execution matches the blueprints with millimeter precision.
