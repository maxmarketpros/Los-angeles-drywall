const faqs = [
    {
        question: "What is the primary advantage of the Design-Build model vs. Traditional Bid?",
        answer: "The traditional model forces the client to act as a referee between an architect whose plans may be over budget, and a builder who says the plans are flawed. The Design-Build model provided by HRF Customs eliminates this adversarial relationship. We collaborate with the architectural team immediately, acting as a single, unified point of accountability for both the aesthetic vision and the physical budget."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I bring my own architect to a Design-Build project with HRF Customs?",
        answer: "Yes, absolutely. We frequently partner with elite external architectural firms. In these scenarios, we act as the 'Construction Manager at Risk.' We bring our heavy hitting preconstruction team to sit alongside your chosen architect, advising on supply chain timelines, structural feasibility in Cache Valley, and real-time cost data while they design."
    },
    {
        question: "How does Design-Build save time on luxury projects?",
        answer: "In a traditional build, you must wait months for architectural plans to be 100% finished before you can even solicit bids from builders—a process that takes weeks. With HRF Customs integrated early, we can begin securing long-lead materials (like custom Swiss windows or specialized steel) and pulling early foundation permits while the final interior finishes are still being designed."
    },
    {
        question: "Does Design-Build limit my creative choices?",
        answer: "No. It actually protects your creative choices by ensuring they are financially and structurally viable. There is nothing worse than falling in love with a soaring architectural design only to find out twelve months later that it costs double what you anticipated. We ground the creative process in reality."
    },
    {
        question: "Who is ultimately responsible if there is a flaw in the construction?",
        answer: "Under the HRF Customs Design-Build umbrella, the buck stops entirely with us. Because we approved the constructability of the plans and executed the labor, there is absolutely zero finger-pointing. We take master accountability for the final generational asset."

                                    Building a multi-million dollar luxury home in Paradise, Utah is an inherently complex endeavor. The traditional construction model—where a client hires an architect, finishes the designs, and then blindly solicits bids from disconnected builders—is fundamentally broken for projects of this magnitude. It inevitably breeds financial overruns, delayed timelines, and adversarial finger-pointing when paper theories clash with job site realities.

                                    As a premier design-build contractor, HRF Customs destroys this disconnect. We believe that immense value is created during the preconstruction phase. By integrating our master builders alongside the architectural team from day one, we provide critical, real-time feedback on constructability, specialized material supply chains, and aggressive cost-controls before a single permit is ever submitted in Cache Valley.
                                </p>

Whether engineering massive retaining walls or specifying bespoke interior finishes, we ensure the creative vision is brutally protected and flawlessly executed.
